    "The `rotl` function performs a **left bit rotation** on a **32-bit unsigned integer**. Left rotation shifts bits to the left and moves the overflow bits back to the right side, effectively cycling the bits.\n",

    "- **Ensures 32-bit unsigned integer**: The input value `x` is masked using `x &= 0xffffffff` to ensure it remains within the **32-bit range**.\n",
    "- **Handles large rotations**: Since rotating by `n` positions is equivalent to rotating by `n % 32`, the function reduces unnecessary operations using `n %= 32`.\n",
    "- **Performs bit rotation**: The function shifts `x` left by `n` bits and shifts it right by `(32 - n)` bits, then combines the results using bitwise OR (`|`).\n",

    "The `maj` function implements the **majority function**, which is commonly used in cryptographic hash functions like **SHA-256**. It determines the majority value for each bit position among three 32-bit unsigned integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionality\n",
    "- **Ensures 32-bit unsigned integers**:  \n",
    "  The input values `x`, `y`, and `z` are masked using `x &= 0xffffffff`, `y &= 0xffffffff`, and `z &= 0xffffffff` to ensure they remain within the **32-bit range**.\n",
    "- **Computes the majority function**:  \n",
    "  - For each bit position, the function determines which value (0 or 1) appears at least twice among `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n",
    "  - This is achieved using the bitwise formula:  \n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    (x \\& y) | (x \\& z) | (y \\& z)\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "- **Uses efficient bitwise operations**:  \n",
    "  - The term `x & y` retains bits where both `x` and `y` have `1`.\n",
    "  - The term `x & z` retains bits where both `x` and `z` have `1`.\n",
    "  - The term `y & z` retains bits where both `y` and `z` have `1`.\n",
    "  - Combining these with bitwise OR (`|`) results in the majority bit selection.\n",
    "- **Maintains 32-bit result**:  \n",
    "  The final result is masked using `& 0xFFFFFFFF` to ensure it stays within **32 bits**.\n"

    "## Task 7: Turing Machines – Adding 1 to a Binary Number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this task, we design a simple Turing Machine that adds 1 to a binary number written on its tape. The machine starts at the left-most non-blank symbol and treats the right-most symbol as the least significant bit (LSB). The Turing Machine simulates the binary addition (increment) process as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traverse to the LSB:**  \n",
    "   The machine moves right until it reaches the right-most digit of the binary number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Addition Operation:**  \n",
    "   - If the current (LSB) symbol is `0`, it is replaced with `1` and the machine halts (no carry is needed).  \n",
    "   - If the symbol is `1`, it is changed to `0` (indicating a carry), and the machine moves one cell to the left to continue processing the carry.  \n",
    "   - If the carry propagates past the left-most digit, the machine prepends a `1` to the tape.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Halting:**  \n",
    "   The machine halts after the addition is complete and the tape now reflects the incremented binary number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "- **Input Tape:** `100111`  \n",
    "- **Expected Output Tape:** `101000`\n",
