    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The `rotl` function performs a **left bit rotation** on a **32-bit unsigned integer**. Left rotation shifts bits to the left and moves the overflow bits back to the right side, effectively cycling the bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionality\n",
    "- **Ensures 32-bit unsigned integer**: The input value `x` is masked using `x &= 0xffffffff` to ensure it remains within the **32-bit range**.\n",
    "- **Handles large rotations**: Since rotating by `n` positions is equivalent to rotating by `n % 32`, the function reduces unnecessary operations using `n %= 32`.\n",
    "- **Performs bit rotation**: The function shifts `x` left by `n` bits and shifts it right by `(32 - n)` bits, then combines the results using bitwise OR (`|`).\n",
    "- **Maintains 32-bit result**: The final result is masked using `& 0xFFFFFFFF` to ensure that it does not exceed 32 bits.\n",

    "The `maj` function implements the **majority function**, which is commonly used in cryptographic hash functions like **SHA-256**. It determines the majority value for each bit position among three 32-bit unsigned integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n",

    "### Functionality\n",
    "- **Ensures 32-bit unsigned integers**:  \n",
    "  The input values `x`, `y`, and `z` are masked using `x &= 0xffffffff`, `y &= 0xffffffff`, and `z &= 0xffffffff` to ensure they remain within the **32-bit range**.\n",
    "- **Computes the majority function**:  \n",
    "  - For each bit position, the function determines which value (0 or 1) appears at least twice among `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n",

    "    \\[\n",
    "    (x \\& y) | (x \\& z) | (y \\& z)\n",

    "  - The term `y & z` retains bits where both `y` and `z` have `1`.\n",
    "  - Combining these with bitwise OR (`|`) results in the majority bit selection.\n",

    "\n",
    "This Python script defines a function `sha256_padding(file_path)` that computes the padding for a file as specified in the SHA256 algorithm. The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Reading:**\n",
    "   - The file is created (or overwritten) and opened in binary write mode to write the bytes for the string `abc`.\n",
    "   - The file is then re-opened in binary read mode to load its content.\n",
    "   - The length of the file in bytes is determined and then converted into bits (by multiplying by 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Padding Construction:**\n",
    "   - A byte with the value `0x80` is appended first. In binary, `0x80` is `10000000`, which effectively adds a single `1` bit followed by seven `0` bits.\n",
    "   - The number of `0x00` bytes required is calculated so that the total length of the data (original data + `0x80` + zero padding) becomes 56 bytes modulo 64. This leaves room for the final 8 bytes.\n",
    "   - The final 8 bytes are used to append the 64-bit big-endian representation of the original message length (in bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output:**\n",
    "   - The complete padding is printed in hexadecimal format.\n",
