    "- **Ensures 32-bit unsigned integer**: The input value `x` is masked using `x &= 0xffffffff` to ensure it remains within the **32-bit range**.\n",

I found it to be a well-structured example of how bitwise operations can be performed cleanly in Python. The use of masking to maintain the 32-bit constraint and the modulo operation to handle rotations beyond the word size demonstrate a good understanding of low-level data handling. Overall, it's a straightforward but insightful task that reinforces the importance of precision and attention to detail in systems-level programming."

    "  - For each bit position, the function determines which value (0 or 1) appears at least twice among `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n",

    "This code is a clear example of using trial division to find prime numbers. The is_prime_trial_division function does the job well, checking up to the square root, which makes it reasonably efficient for small numbers. The loop in first_n_primes_trial_division is straightforward—just keeps testing numbers until it finds the desired amount of primes. While it’s not the fastest method out there, especially for big ranges, it’s great for learning how prime-checking works and for smaller-scale use cases. Simple, effective, and easy to follow"

It does a good job of marking non-prime numbers in a clean and logical way, starting from each prime's square, which avoids redundant work. Using math.sqrt(limit) as the upper limit for sieving makes it both correct and fast. The function is great for generating a lot of primes quickly, and picking a slightly higher limit to ensure 100 primes is a smart move. All in all, it’s a nice, efficient upgrade from trial division and a great example of using classic algorithms in Python."

The modular approach, with separate functions for hashing and zero counting, makes the code readable and maintainable. I believe the code could be more versatile by allowing dynamic input rather than relying on a hardcoded list of words. Incorporating user input or file-based word lists would enhance usability. Additionally, adding error handling to ensure valid string inputs would make the script more robust."

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this task, we design a simple Turing Machine that adds 1 to a binary number written on its tape. The machine starts at the left-most non-blank symbol and treats the right-most symbol as the least significant bit (LSB). The Turing Machine simulates the binary addition (increment) process as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traverse to the LSB:**  \n",
    "   The machine moves right until it reaches the right-most digit of the binary number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Addition Operation:**  \n",
    "   - If the current (LSB) symbol is `0`, it is replaced with `1` and the machine halts (no carry is needed).  \n",
    "   - If the symbol is `1`, it is changed to `0` (indicating a carry), and the machine moves one cell to the left to continue processing the carry.  \n",
    "   - If the carry propagates past the left-most digit, the machine prepends a `1` to the tape.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Halting:**  \n",
    "   The machine halts after the addition is complete and the tape now reflects the incremented binary number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
