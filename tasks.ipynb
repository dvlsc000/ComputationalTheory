    "Rotates the bits in `x` to the left by `n` positions.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Ensures 32-bit unsigned integer**: The input value `x` is masked using `x &= 0xffffffff` to ensure it remains within the **32-bit range**.\n",
    "- **Handles large rotations**: Since rotating by `n` positions is equivalent to rotating by `n % 32`, the function reduces unnecessary operations using `n %= 32`.\n",
    "- **Performs bit rotation**: The function shifts `x` left by `n` bits and shifts it right by `(32 - n)` bits, then combines the results using bitwise OR (`|`).\n",

    "1. **Majority bits should be selected correctly**\n",

    "   - Expected behavior: For each bit position, the majority bit (appearing at least twice among `x`, `y`, and `z`) is selected.\n",

    "2. **All inputs are the same and should return the same value**\n",
    "   - This ensures that when `x`, `y`, and `z` are identical, the function simply returns that value.\n",
    "   - Expected behavior: The result should match `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **One input differs completely**\n",
    "   - This verifies that the function correctly selects the majority bit when two inputs are identical and the third differs.\n",
    "   - Expected behavior: The result should match the majority of `y` and `z`, as they have the same bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Random bit pattern**\n",
    "   - This tests the function with a varied mix of bit values.\n",

    "\n",
    "This Python script defines a function `sha256_padding(file_path)` that computes the padding for a file as specified in the SHA256 algorithm. The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Reading:**\n",
    "   - The file is created (or overwritten) and opened in binary write mode to write the bytes for the string `abc`.\n",

    "   - The length of the file in bytes is determined and then converted into bits (by multiplying by 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Padding Construction:**\n",
    "   - A byte with the value `0x80` is appended first. In binary, `0x80` is `10000000`, which effectively adds a single `1` bit followed by seven `0` bits.\n",
    "   - The number of `0x00` bytes required is calculated so that the total length of the data (original data + `0x80` + zero padding) becomes 56 bytes modulo 64. This leaves room for the final 8 bytes.\n",
    "   - The final 8 bytes are used to append the 64-bit big-endian representation of the original message length (in bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output:**\n",
    "   - The complete padding is printed in hexadecimal format.\n",
    "   - After printing, the temporary file is removed to clean up.\n",
